Dependency Injection :- 
 
Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object.
Let us segregate the dependency injection into dependency and injection

A "dependency" is an object that can be used, for example a service. Instead of a client specifying which service it will use, something tells the client what service to use. The "injection" refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the object (a client) that would use it.

It is an act of injecting services to the client from outside i.e receiving dependencies from outside.
